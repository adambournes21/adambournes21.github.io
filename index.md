I’m currently taking a short break from frontier AI research to solve OCR for Sanskrit. I feel it critical that the classical Indian literary canon be immortalized in the training corpus for superintelligence.

At OpenAI, I helped train GPT-5 and future models. I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University in 2023 with an honors thesis on semantics in multimodal LLMs.
